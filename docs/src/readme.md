Ozhitoon, to build or be built (Objibwe), encompasses all completed and potential
designs. These designs are to be expanded upon and built within their own repos
or submodules within Tawa org. Each chapter encompasses a sub-directory and a design
and should seek to fully map out the design from top to bottom. These designs are freely licensed and feel free to copy, alter, or develop upon them in you find any interesting. Please email maxweirz@gmail.com for any info you need (Max Weirzbicki) or just to chat.
