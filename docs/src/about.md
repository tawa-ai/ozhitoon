Max Weirzbicki (Weirzy, Max, or Pickles) is a Ukrainian and Native American Staff Software Engineer in ML Platform/Infra/Systems who comes from Zhytomyr and Wind River. He has worked in AI at scale for companies like AWS, Lyft L5, Woven by Toyota, and Allen Institute for 8+ years. The main goal of this work is to address hard to solve problems of ML that have been learned from years of pain and mental anguish.
